She is a current employee of IBM where she started as a Junior Data Scientist at the Global Business Services (GBS) in 2018. Her main role was making meaning out of data for their Oil and Gas clients through basic statistics and advanced Machine Learning algorithms. The highlight of her time in GBS was creating a customized end-to-end Machine learning and Statistics solution on optimizing operations in the Oil and Gas wells. She moved to the Cognitive Systems Group as a Senior Data Scientist where she will be providing the team with actionable insights using Data Science techniques and further improve processes through building machine learning solutions. She recently joined the IBM Developer Skills Network group where she brings her real-world experience to the courses she creates.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Change Log\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Version | Changed By      | Change Description                     |\n","| ----------------- | ------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n","| 2020-08-14        | 0.1     | Aije Egwaikhide | Created the initial version of the lab |\n","| 2022-05-10        | 0.2     | Lakshmi Holla   | Added exercise for Bar plot            |\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Copyright © 2020 IBM Corporation.
