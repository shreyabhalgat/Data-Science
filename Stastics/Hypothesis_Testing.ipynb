The next step is to define a null hypothesis, which is a model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is not real. Then compute the p-value, which is the probability of the null hypothesis being true, and finally interpret the result of the p-value, if the value is low, the effect is said to be statistically significant, which means that the null hypothesis may not be accurate.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Objectives\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["*   Import Libraries\n","*   Lab exercises\n","    *   Stating the hypothesis\n","    *   Levene's Test for equality\n","    *   Preparing your data for hypothesis testing\n","*   Quiz\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["***\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Import Libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["All Libraries required for this lab are listed below.
